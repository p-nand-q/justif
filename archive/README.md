# Archive Directory

This directory contains the original Python implementation of Justif for historical reference.

## Contents

- `justif/` - Original Python implementation from p-nand-q.com
  - `justif.py` - Python interpreter for Justif
  - `hello1.justif`, `hello2.justif` - Hello World examples
  - `fibonacci.justif` - Fibonacci sequence example
  - `atoi.justif` - String to integer conversion example

## Notes

The original Python implementation was created as a proof of concept for the Justif language. The Go implementation in the parent directory is a complete rewrite with:
- Better performance
- Proper error handling
- More comprehensive test coverage
- Fixed edge cases with `_` and `$` tokens

## Historical Value

These files are preserved to:
1. Document the evolution of the language
2. Allow comparison between original and new implementation
3. Preserve the original examples as written by Gerson Kurz
